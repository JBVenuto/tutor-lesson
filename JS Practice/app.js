// Because Nathan knows it is important to stay hydrated, he drinks 0.5 litres of water per hour of cycling.
// You get given the time in hours and you need to return the number of litres Nathan will drink,

// For example:
// time = 3 ----> litres = 1
// time = 6.7---> litres = 3
// time = 11.8--> litres = 5
